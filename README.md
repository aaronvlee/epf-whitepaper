This repository hosts the white paper and materials for the **Entropic Persistence Framework (EPF)** — a six-layer architecture for designing and evaluating persistent, non‑biological life systems that resist entropy across physical and informational layers.

> Brenes Bobea, J. H. (2025). *The Entropic Persistence Framework (EPF): A Foundational Blueprint for Post-Human Intelligence*. (Version v1.0.0). DOI: **TBD**

A machine-readable citation is in `CITATION.cff`. After you mint a DOI (e.g., via Zenodo), update both places.

## Summary
**EPF** treats persistence as an applied fight against entropy. It layers concerns from **L0** (energy, hardware, reliability) up to **L5** (governance, merge/split, evolution), with measurable metrics per layer and safety rails for self-modification. Bitcoin is used as a persistence analogy for open, energy‑backed consensus and proposal‑driven evolution.

## Feedback & discussion
Open a **GitHub Discussion** or **Issue** with concrete critique, references, or experiments. Please prefer primary/peer‑reviewed sources when challenging claims.

## Reproducibility / Artifacts
- White paper PDF and DOCX are included. Diagrams and code examples (if any) will live under `docs/` and `examples/` in future releases.
