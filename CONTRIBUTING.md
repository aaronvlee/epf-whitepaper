# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in improving EPF. Please:

1. Open an Issue describing the change, with references (prefer primary/peer‑reviewed literature).
2. If proposing a structural change, use a short **EIP (EPF Improvement Proposal)** format:
   - Motivation, Prior Art, Proposed Changes (layers affected), Metrics, Rollback
3. Submit a PR referencing the Issue/EIP.
4. For significant changes, expect staged review (shadow -> canary -> merge).

## Style
- Keep claims backed by citations.
- Equations: LaTeX in Markdown is fine.
- Prefer clear, engineering‑style prose over jargon.
